# Objective:
Develop a React component named ItemList to display a list of items using JSX.

## Instructions:
1. Define a functional component named ItemList using JSX syntax.
2. Inside the component, declare an array containing some sample items (e.g. strings or objects).
3. Utilize JSX to map over the array of items and render each item as a list element (`<li>`).
4. Ensure the component is exported for use elsewhere in your application.
